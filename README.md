# JavaScript Playground

This repository is a JavaScript playground to learn new ES6+ features, compare speeds and test new stuff. Every test result here is subjective to my machine and could change if run on yours.

## Functions

- `random.js`: A balanced random function based on `Math.random()` where boundary values have the same probability as any other value inside the range
- `christmas-tree.js`: The famous Christmas tree exercise

## Experiments
- `objects-search`: I compared several search methods for large arrays of simple objects
