# JavaScript Playground

This repository is a JavaScript playground to test new ES6+ features, compare speed and so on. Every result here is subjective to my machine and could change if run on yours.

## Codepen

- **The Lightbulb**: this is just a micro app to tinker with the binding of the *this* keyword and jQuery custom events. That's not even how circuits work, but still it was fun! Codepen.io [https://codepen.io/alaindet/full/YEjGVO](https://codepen.io/alaindet/full/YEjGVO)

- **Integer to Roman number converter**: this little app in **vanilla JavaScript** converts an integer number to a roman number. It accepts any integer from 1 to 3999 since no _vinculum_ is used. A _vinculum_ is just a sign put on roman letters to multiply it by 1000, so

  | Vincula | Multiply by   |
  | ------- | ------------- |
  | 1       | 1,000         |
  | 2       | 1,000,000     |
  | 3       | 1,000,000,000 |

- **Tic-Tac-Toe**: written in jQuery, it's the Tic Tac Toe game. Performs game-specific checks to enforce the rules, includes a scoreboard. Codepen.io [https://codepen.io/alaindet/pen/VMjXey](https://codepen.io/alaindet/pen/VMjXey)
